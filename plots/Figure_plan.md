# Figure placement in paper

## Figure 1: Plot of oscillations of 5 qubits with 0 error
### Placement:
    - Near example II.1
    - Ended up using 1000 shots

## Figure 2: Plot of oscillations of 5 qubits with 2% reset error
### Placement:
    - Near example III.1

## Figure 3: Plot of how probability of returning to |0> state
    - highlights that qubit scaling makes oscillations less of a problem
    a. scales with reset probability with fixed number of qubits
        - 5 qubits
        - 1 copy of register b
        - Want to highlight the low error regime.
    b. scales with number of qubits for fixed error rate
        - Low error regime ~2%
        - 1, 5 and 20 qubits all work fine
### Placement:
    - Could go either near example III.1

## Figure 4:  Plot with additional copies of register b and error correction
    - Now we increase the error rate (~95%) and see how error correction can help!
    - get number of copies from Hakop's email (probably labeled c_n)
    a. With 5 qubits    
    b. With 20 qubits
### Placement:
    - in section 4
